# APCModule
See library documentation in
https://telmomm.github.io/APCModule/

## What does the library do?
It facilitates the integration and control of the APC220 model, streamlining wireless communication for projects with microcontrollers, especially the configuration part, which used to be terribly tedious and only possible with Windows OS and a USB-TTL converter.

## Why the APC220 model?
It's a robust choice for short-distance wireless communication, and this library makes its implementation easier for robotics, remote monitoring, and similar projects. You can check the technical specifications here.
